# FabJoins: FabJoins: Fab fastener management system.
While the most common fasteners are screws and bolts, there are others like rivets, set screws,
cotter pins, etc.  This package centralizes all of the issues associated with fasteners
so that changing a fastener does not become a nightmare of having to individually find
each fastener and make manual changes to each one.  The change is made in once place and
it propagates to all locations where the fastener is used.

The FabJoins module deals with the following issues:
* Hole Drilling/Milling:
  Getting a hole of the of the correct size and depth at the correct location on a part.
* Threading:
  Ensuring that the hole is properly threaded using the appropriate threading tool.
* Countersink/Counterbore:
  Ensuring that appropriate counter sinks and counter bores occur at the correct depth
* Deburring:
  Deburring hole edges.
* Fastener stacks:
  Specifying the washers, lock washers, nuts, cotter pins, etc. to screws/bolts.
* Substitutions:
  Graceful substitutions between imperial (North America) vs. metric hardware (everyone else.)
* Lengths:
  Selecting appropriate screw/bolt lengths to deal with parametric changes to shapes.
* Bill of Materials:
  Collecting all of the fasteners into a bill of materials.
* Assembly View:
  When assembly views are supported, all of the fasteners are exploded out with a dashed
  line to connect them all.  (Not even remotely started yet.)
* Fastener WorkBench:
  The FreeCAD Fasteners workbench is used wherever possible.  (This may not happen.)

The basic bottom up class hierarchy is:

* FabOption: A base class for the sub-classes immediately below:
  * FabHead: The fastener head definition along with counter sink/bore information.
  * FabWasher: washer that is attached on the fastener.
  * FabNut: A nut that threads onto the fastener.
* FabFasten: A profile for a set of related hardware for using a fastener.
* FabJoin: A specific instance of a FabBasten that has a start and end point.

I addition the "public" classes listed immediately above.  There are a number of "private" classes
of the form `Fab_` that are used to implement everything.  The interfaces to the classes are
not stable and can be changed at will by the developers; thus, they should not be depended upon.

A FabFasten basically lists a thread profile (i.e. #4-4, M3x0.5, etc), the driver head,
associated lock washers, regular washers, nuts, etc.  These are specified as a list
of FabOption's (i.e. FabHead, FabWasher, FabNut, etc.)

A FabJoin specifies a FabJoins with both a start point and an end point.  The first end point is
the specifies a point just under the screw/bolt head and any regular/lock washers just below
the head.  The end point is where any additional regular/lock washers and nuts go at the other
end of the fastener.

The Part module has three basic FabOperation's -- FabThread, FabClose, and FabLoose,
which vary the diameter of the Part Hole.  These operations take a FabJoin, verifies that
the fastener is perpendicular to the mount plane, and drills the correct diameter hole to
the correct depth.

Eventually, the system will create a BOM (Bill Of Materials) that lists all of the needed
hardware.

## <a name="fabjoins--fab-idrilltap"></a>11 Class Fab_IDrillTap:

Imperial Screw/Bolt Drill Selection.
The standard imperial screw/bolt major shaft diameters are measured in inches.
The three primary characteristics are:
* Major shaft diameter:
  The major shaft diameters that are less than 0.25in are given "number" names "000", "00", "0",
  "1", "2", through "12".  There is no "7", "9", or "11".  After 0.25in, sizes are specified
  as fraction inches -- "1/4", "5/16", "3/8", ..., "1-3/4".
* Threads Pitch:
  The thread pitch is measured in threads per inch and is always an integer.
* Pitch Series:
  The three imperial pitch series that specify the threads per inch for a screw/bolt.
  The three series are course (NC), fine (NF), extremely fine (NEF).  There are also
  some pitch values that are non standard (NS), but still available.
  While screw/bolts are available in all three series, most are restricted to only one or
  two of the thread series.

Imperial drill sizes are number drills (1-80), letter drills (A-Z), and fractional drills
(3/64 - 1-3/4.)  The drill diameters of these series all overlap.  Many Imperial drill sets
come with selections of all three drill series.

Attributes:
* *Size* (str):
  This is the "number" or "fractional" shaft size (e.g. "000", "0", "1/4", "1-1/4".)
* *MajorDiameter* (float):
   This is the major shaft diameter in inches.
* *ThreadsPerInch* (int):
  This is the threads pitch in thread per inch.  It is always an integer.
* *Series* (str):
   This the pitch series -- "NF", "NS", "NC" or "NS".
   There are a few "standard" pitches are non-standard that are marked as "-".
* *MinorDiameter* (float): This is the inner thread diameter in inches.
* *Thread75Name* (str): The drill name to use for 75% threading in soft materials.
* *Thread75Inch* (float): The *Thread75Name* drill diameter in inches.
